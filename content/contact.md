Welcome to visit our website. This is only a modest beginning, but the site is growing day by day.
Welcome to a wonderful place - the Costa Tropical. Why is it like this? We will try to show you. It's
worth being here at any time of year, every season has something special to offer.
December is, as always, marked by Christmas, saying goodbye to the old year and welcoming the New
Year. But December and January in Motril, Salobreña, Almuñecar is also a very good time for hiking and
excursions. The weather is usually favourable, neither hot nor cold, just right for such activities.
One day trips from Costa Tropical? Why not!
We would like to show you another extraordinary place: the Granada Geopark with fantastic views and
nature, and the nearby historic Guadix with monuments still from Roman times, and an unusual district of
rock houses, inhabited. Or perhaps you might be interested in a balloon cruise over Geopark and Guadix.
We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy New Year.
